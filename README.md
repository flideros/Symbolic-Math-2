# Symbolic Math 2

This is the second version of my personal coding lab for coding in f#. The previous lab depended heavily on packages, so in this version, I will try to keep the dependencies to a minimum in this iteration. 

The **Math Lab UI** project is a minimal C# implementation to launch the WPF app. 

The **Math Lab** project is the main entry point to the lab. It is currently based on a tab control so the lab can host any arbitrary WPF content. All other F# controls I develop will use this project to launch from.

The **Basic Calculator** project is a carry over from the previous lab and one of the first WPF controls I have written.

Feel free to clone this repository to code and test your own code or follow along as I grow this lab. 

Sincerely,

FLideros
